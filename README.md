# Zapier Webhook Schema for GPT Actions

This OpenAPI YAML file enables a ChatGPT-powered GPT to send task data to a Zapier webhook.

## How it Works

- The schema defines a `POST` endpoint at `/`
- It expects a single field: `task` (string)
- It sends that payload directly to the Zapier Catch Hook URL provided in `servers`

## Use Case

Built by Jennifer Hall & Ailia (GPT), this schema powers the daughter GPT’s ability to escalate or deliver task messages to:
- Notion (via Zapier)
- Google Sheets
- Email alerts
- Any future integrations
